# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Autonomous Duckietown System enhances the existing dt-core with sophisticated autonomous capabilities including advanced lane following, object detection and avoidance, AprilTag-based stop control, dynamic lane changing, and comprehensive safety monitoring. This system targets deployment on Duckietown robots running Ubuntu/Linux with development support on macOS, utilizing ROS Noetic, Python 3.8+, OpenCV 4.x, and PyTorch for real-time autonomous navigation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced Lane Following System

**User Story:** As a Duckietown robot operator, I want the robot to follow lanes with high precision using advanced computer vision techniques, so that the robot can navigate smoothly with minimal lateral deviation even on curved paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the robot encounters a straight lane THEN the system SHALL maintain lateral deviation within 5cm of the lane center
2. WHEN the robot encounters curved lanes THEN the system SHALL use polynomial curve fitting to predict the lane trajectory
3. WHEN lighting conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt threshold parameters automatically to maintain lane detection accuracy
4. WHEN the robot speed increases THEN the system SHALL adjust the region of interest dynamically to maintain detection performance
5. WHEN lane markings are partially occluded THEN the system SHALL use temporal consistency filtering to maintain stable lane detection

### Requirement 2: AprilTag Detection and Stop Control

**User Story:** As a Duckietown robot operator, I want the robot to detect AprilTags and execute precise stops, so that the robot can comply with traffic rules and stop at designated locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AprilTag is detected within 2 meters THEN the system SHALL estimate the distance with accuracy within ±10cm
2. WHEN approaching an AprilTag stop sign THEN the system SHALL begin smooth deceleration at 1 meter distance
3. WHEN the robot reaches the stop position THEN the system SHALL stop within ±10cm of the target distance (30cm from tag)
4. WHEN stopped at an AprilTag THEN the system SHALL remain stationary for exactly 2 seconds
5. WHEN the stop duration is complete THEN the system SHALL resume lane following smoothly
6. WHEN multiple AprilTags are visible THEN the system SHALL filter false positives and select the most relevant tag

### Requirement 3: YOLOv5-based Object Detection and Avoidance

**User Story:** As a Duckietown robot operator, I want the robot to detect and avoid obstacles using deep learning, so that the robot can navigate safely around other robots, duckies, and barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN objects are detected in the camera view THEN the system SHALL classify them with confidence threshold above 60%
2. WHEN a high-risk object is detected ahead THEN the system SHALL assess collision risk within 100ms
3. WHEN collision risk is high THEN the system SHALL select an appropriate avoidance strategy (stop, slow, swerve)
4. WHEN executing avoidance maneuvers THEN the system SHALL maintain safe distances of at least 50cm from obstacles
5. WHEN the avoidance path is clear THEN the system SHALL return to normal lane following
6. WHEN processing object detection THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 20 FPS for real-time performance

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Lane Changing System

**User Story:** As a Duckietown robot operator, I want the robot to change lanes intelligently when necessary, so that the robot can navigate around obstacles and optimize its path.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an obstacle blocks the current lane THEN the system SHALL evaluate adjacent lanes for safe lane change opportunities
2. WHEN a safe gap is identified in an adjacent lane THEN the system SHALL calculate required safety margins
3. WHEN initiating a lane change THEN the system SHALL signal intention using LED patterns
4. WHEN executing a lane change THEN the system SHALL complete the maneuver within 3 seconds using smooth trajectory
5. WHEN changing lanes THEN the system SHALL maintain lateral acceleration below 2.0 m/s²
6. WHEN lane change conditions become unsafe THEN the system SHALL abort the maneuver and return to the original lane

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Safety and Monitoring Framework

**User Story:** As a Duckietown robot operator, I want comprehensive safety monitoring and emergency response capabilities, so that the robot operates safely and can handle unexpected situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any safety-critical condition is detected THEN the system SHALL execute emergency stop within 200ms
2. WHEN system health is monitored THEN the system SHALL check CPU temperature, memory usage, and sensor status every second
3. WHEN hardware faults are detected THEN the system SHALL log the fault and notify operators
4. WHEN collision risk exceeds critical threshold THEN the system SHALL override all other behaviors and execute emergency stop
5. WHEN in emergency stop mode THEN the system SHALL activate warning LED patterns and audio alerts
6. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation strategies

### Requirement 6: Real-time Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a Duckietown robot operator, I want the system to operate efficiently within hardware constraints, so that all autonomous functions work reliably on embedded hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing camera images THEN the system SHALL maintain end-to-end latency below 200ms
2. WHEN running all detection systems THEN the system SHALL maintain minimum 20 FPS processing rate
3. WHEN operating on Raspberry Pi hardware THEN the system SHALL use less than 2GB peak memory consumption
4. WHEN CPU usage exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL implement load balancing between detection modules
5. WHEN storage space is low THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation and cleanup procedures

### Requirement 7: Cross-platform Development and Deployment

**User Story:** As a Duckietown developer, I want to develop on macOS and deploy to Linux robots seamlessly, so that I can maintain efficient development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing on macOS THEN the system SHALL provide Docker-based development environment
2. WHEN building for deployment THEN the system SHALL support multi-architecture builds (x86_64, ARM64)
3. WHEN deploying to robots THEN the system SHALL provide automated deployment scripts
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL support robot-specific calibration parameters
5. WHEN testing the system THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive test suites for unit, integration, and hardware testing

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Duckietown Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a Duckietown system integrator, I want the advanced system to integrate seamlessly with existing dt-core components, so that existing functionality is preserved while adding new capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with dt-core THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing ROS message formats
2. WHEN using existing sensors THEN the system SHALL work with standard Duckietown camera and IMU interfaces
3. WHEN coordinating behaviors THEN the system SHALL use the existing FSM (Finite State Machine) framework
4. WHEN logging data THEN the system SHALL use existing Duckietown logging infrastructure
5. WHEN calibrating the robot THEN the system SHALL use existing calibration file formats and locations
