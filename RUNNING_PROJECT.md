Run and Validation Guide

Goal: get the repository's ROS nodes runnable and verify publisher/subscriber topology.

Quick checks (local):
- Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
- Run the smoke checks which validate Python syntax and produce a topic report:

  scripts/smoke_check.sh

What the repo already includes (helpful):
- A DTROS shim at `src/packages/duckietown_dtros_shim/src/duckietown/dtros.py` which patches `rospy.Publisher` so `dt_topic_type=` kwargs won't crash.
- A `src/scripts/ros_topic_inspector.py` tool that lists literal `rospy.Publisher`/`rospy.Subscriber` calls found in source files.

Important runtime prerequisites (not handled automatically):
- A ROS 1 installation (Melodic/Noetic depending on your OS). This repository targets ROS 1 Python nodes.
- The appropriate Python packages (numpy, cv2, yaml, etc.). Many nodes check for these at startup.
- A running `roscore` and correct ROS environment (ROS_MASTER_URI, ROS_HOSTNAME) to actually start nodes.

Next steps to make all packages fully runnable:
1) Run the smoke checks and inspect the `ros_topic_inspector` output for mismatches between literal topics.
2) For dynamic topic names (f-strings, get_param use), inspect node launches and ensure consistent namespace usage.
3) Create or adapt `roslaunch`/`docker` runfiles that start the required nodes in the right order (camera -> decoder -> rectifier -> detectors -> controllers).
4) Where nodes use time synchronization, ensure `message_filters` is configured and topics publish timestamps (header.stamp) correctly.
5) Run integration tests on a machine with ROS installed and iteratively fix runtime exceptions.

If you'd like, I can:
- Prepare a set of `roslaunch` files or a Dockerfile to run the full system on Linux (recommended).
- Create unit/smoke tests that run in CI (without ROS master) by mocking `rospy` to verify publishers/subscribers and callback signatures.

Tell me which of the above you want me to do next: produce launch files, add Docker support, or implement runtime tests.
