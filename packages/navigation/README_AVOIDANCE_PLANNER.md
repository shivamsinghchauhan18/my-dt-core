# Avoidance Planner Implementation

## Overview

The Avoidance Planner is an intelligent obstacle avoidance system that implements multiple avoidance strategies for safe autonomous navigation. It integrates with the existing navigation system to provide sophisticated collision avoidance capabilities.

## Requirements Addressed

This implementation addresses the following requirements from the Advanced Autonomous Duckietown System specification:

### Requirement 3.3: Strategy Selection
**"WHEN collision risk is high THEN the system SHALL select an appropriate avoidance strategy (stop, slow, swerve)"**

The system implements three primary avoidance strategies:
- **STOP**: Emergency stop for critical situations (distance < 30cm or TTC < 1.0s)
- **SLOW**: Speed reduction for moderate risk situations (distance < 80cm or high-risk objects)
- **SWERVE**: Lateral avoidance maneuver for dynamic obstacles when safe to do so

### Requirement 3.4: Safety Distance Maintenance
**"WHEN executing avoidance maneuvers THEN the system SHALL maintain safe distances of at least 50cm from obstacles"**

The system enforces a minimum safety margin of 50cm as required:
- `minimum_safety_margin = 0.5m` (exactly 50cm as specified)
- `preferred_safety_margin = 0.7m` (70cm for additional safety)
- `lateral_safety_margin = 0.6m` (60cm for lateral clearance)

All generated trajectories are validated to ensure they maintain these safety margins.

### Requirement 3.5: Return to Normal Operation
**"WHEN the avoidance path is clear THEN the system SHALL return to normal lane following"**

The system automatically returns to normal lane following when:
- No high-risk objects are detected for sufficient time (>1 second)
- Current avoidance maneuver is completed
- Path ahead is confirmed clear

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AvoidancePlanner**: Main planning class that orchestrates strategy selection and trajectory generation
2. **Strategy Selection Engine**: Analyzes risk assessments and selects appropriate avoidance strategies
3. **Trajectory Generator**: Creates smooth, safe trajectories for each strategy type
4. **Safety Validator**: Ensures all trajectories maintain required safety margins
5. **Performance Monitor**: Tracks system performance and success metrics

### Integration Points

- **Enhanced Navigation Node**: Integrates avoidance planner with existing navigation system
- **Risk Assessment Engine**: Receives risk assessments for decision making
- **Existing Path Planning**: Works alongside existing navigation utilities
- **ROS Message System**: Publishes control commands and status information

## Implementation Details

### Strategy Selection Logic

```python
# Priority order (highest to lowest):
1. STOP - Critical distance (< 30cm) OR critical TTC (< 1.0s) OR critical risk objects
2. SLOW - Warning distance (< 80cm) OR high-risk objects present
3. SWERVE - Lateral obstacles AND safe swerving conditions
4. NONE - No high-risk objects detected
```

### Trajectory Generation

#### STOP Trajectory
- Smooth quadratic deceleration profile
- Minimum stop time of 0.5 seconds
- Zero final velocity
- All angular velocities set to zero

#### SLOW Trajectory
- Gradual speed reduction using cosine transition
- Target speed = current_speed × 0.3 (30% of original speed)
- Comfortable deceleration rate (1.0 m/s²)
- Maintains straight course

#### SWERVE Trajectory
- Quintic polynomial lateral motion for smoothness
- Lateral offset of 0.8m with return to center
- Duration of 2.0 seconds
- Angular velocity limits enforced (≤ 1.0 rad/s)
- Slight speed reduction during maneuver (80% of original)

### Safety Validation

All trajectories undergo comprehensive safety validation:

1. **Waypoint Sampling**: Trajectory sampled at regular intervals
2. **Obstacle Prediction**: Future obstacle positions calculated
3. **Clearance Checking**: Distance to obstacles verified at each waypoint
4. **Safety Margin Enforcement**: Minimum 50cm clearance required
5. **Trajectory Rejection**: Unsafe trajectories are rejected

### Performance Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive performance metrics:

- **Strategy Distribution**: Usage statistics for each strategy
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful avoidance maneuvers
- **Execution Times**: Average time for strategy selection and execution
- **Safety Metrics**: Average obstacle clearance and safety margins
- **Real-time Status**: Current state and active strategy

## Configuration Parameters

### Safety Margins
```python
minimum_safety_margin = 0.5      # 50cm - required by specification
preferred_safety_margin = 0.7    # 70cm - preferred margin
lateral_safety_margin = 0.6      # 60cm - lateral clearance
```

### Strategy Thresholds
```python
critical_distance_threshold = 0.3   # 30cm - triggers STOP
warning_distance_threshold = 0.8    # 80cm - triggers SLOW/SWERVE
safe_distance_threshold = 1.5       # 150cm - normal operation
```

### Trajectory Parameters
```python
stop_deceleration_rate = 2.0         # m/s² - emergency stop rate
slow_speed_factor = 0.3              # 30% speed reduction
swerve_lateral_offset = 0.8          # 80cm lateral swerve
swerve_duration = 2.0                # 2 second swerve maneuver
max_angular_velocity = 1.0           # rad/s - turning limit
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from avoidance_planner import AvoidancePlanner

# Initialize planner
planner = AvoidancePlanner()

# Plan avoidance based on risk assessments
strategy, trajectory = planner.plan_avoidance(
    risk_assessments,    # List of (detection, risk_factors, risk_level)
    vehicle_state,       # Current vehicle state
    current_lane_pose    # Optional lane pose information
)

# Execute trajectory if generated
if trajectory:
    control_command = planner.execute_trajectory(trajectory, current_time)
    if control_command:
        # Publish control command
        publish_control_command(control_command)
```

### Integration with Enhanced Navigation

The avoidance planner is automatically integrated with the Enhanced Navigation Node:

```python
# In enhanced_navigation_node.py
self.avoidance_planner = AvoidancePlanner()

# During risk assessment processing
strategy, trajectory = self.avoidance_planner.plan_avoidance(
    risk_assessments, 
    self.current_vehicle_state
)

if trajectory:
    avoidance_command = self.avoidance_planner.execute_trajectory(
        trajectory, timestamp
    )
    self.pub_navigation_command.publish(avoidance_command)
```
