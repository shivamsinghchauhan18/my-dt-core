# Risk Assessment Engine for Enhanced Navigation

## Overview

The Risk Assessment Engine is a comprehensive collision prediction and avoidance system that extends the existing Duckietown navigation package with advanced safety capabilities. It provides real-time risk assessment for detected objects using multi-factor analysis and trajectory prediction.

## Features

### Core Risk Assessment Capabilities

- **Multi-factor Risk Analysis**: Combines distance, velocity, object type, and trajectory factors
- **Real-time Performance**: Completes risk assessment within 100ms requirement
- **Trajectory Intersection Prediction**: Predicts potential collision points and times
- **Time-to-Collision Calculation**: Accurate TTC estimation with safety factors
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed debug information and real-time monitoring

### Risk Factors

1. **Distance Risk**: Exponential decay based on object distance
   - Critical distance: < 0.3m (Risk = 0.9-1.0)
   - Safe distance: 0.3-0.5m (Risk = 0.3-0.9)
   - Warning distance: 0.5-1.0m (Risk decreases exponentially)
   - Far distance: > 1.0m (Low risk)

2. **Velocity Risk**: Based on relative velocity and distance
   - Considers approach speed and distance-dependent scaling
   - Higher risk for fast-approaching objects
   - Reduced risk for distant fast objects

3. **Object Type Risk**: Weighted by object classification
   - Person: 1.0 (highest risk)
   - Barrier/Vehicle: 0.9 (very high risk)
   - Duckiebot: 0.8 (high risk)
   - Cone: 0.6 (medium risk)
   - Unknown: 0.5 (default risk)
   - Duckie: 0.3 (low risk)

4. **Trajectory Risk**: Collision probability based on predicted paths
   - Uses ground projection for coordinate transformation
   - Predicts intersection points and collision probability
   - Considers lateral clearance and safety margins

### Risk Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Immediate emergency stop required (Risk score ≥ 0.75)
- **HIGH**: Avoidance maneuver recommended (Risk score ≥ 0.55)
- **MEDIUM**: Increased caution required (Risk score ≥ 0.3)
- **LOW**: Normal operation (Risk score < 0.3)

## Implementation

### Core Components

#### RiskAssessmentEngine (`risk_assessment_engine.py`)

The main risk assessment class that provides:

```python
class RiskAssessmentEngine:
    def assess_collision_risk(self, detections, vehicle_state) -> List[RiskAssessment]
    def _calculate_distance_risk(self, distance) -> float
    def _calculate_velocity_risk(self, velocity, distance) -> float
    def _calculate_object_type_risk(self, object_class) -> float
    def _predict_trajectory_intersection(self, detection, vehicle_state) -> TrajectoryPrediction
    def _calculate_time_to_collision(self, detection, vehicle_state) -> float
    def _determine_risk_level(self, risk_factors) -> RiskLevel
```

#### EnhancedNavigationNode (`enhanced_navigation_node.py`)

ROS node that integrates risk assessment with navigation:

```python
class EnhancedNavigationNode(DTROS):
    def cb_object_detections(self, msg)  # Process incoming detections
    def perform_risk_assessment(self)    # Execute risk assessment
    def trigger_emergency_stop(self, critical_objects, reason)
    def trigger_avoidance_behavior(self, risk_objects, reason)
```

### Data Structures

#### RiskFactors
```python
@dataclass
class RiskFactors:
    distance_risk: float
    velocity_risk: float
    object_type_risk: float
    trajectory_risk: float
    time_to_collision: float
    lateral_clearance: float
```

#### VehicleState
```python
@dataclass
class VehicleState:
    position: Point
    velocity: Vector3
    heading: float
    timestamp: float
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# Initialize risk assessment engine
engine = RiskAssessmentEngine()

# Create vehicle state
vehicle_state = VehicleState(
    position=Point(0, 0, 0),
    velocity=Vector3(1.0, 0, 0),
    heading=0.0,
    timestamp=time.time()
)

# Assess risk for detected objects
risk_assessments = engine.assess_collision_risk(detections, vehicle_state)

# Process results
for detection, risk_factors, risk_level in risk_assessments:
    if risk_level == RiskLevel.CRITICAL:
        # Trigger emergency stop
        pass
    elif risk_level == RiskLevel.HIGH:
        # Trigger avoidance behavior
        pass
```

### ROS Integration

Launch the enhanced navigation system:

```bash
roslaunch navigation enhanced_navigation.launch veh:=<vehicle_name>
```

Monitor risk assessment:

```bash
# Monitor risk status
rostopic echo /<vehicle_name>/enhanced_navigation_node/risk_status

# Monitor performance metrics
rostopic echo /<vehicle_name>/enhanced_navigation_node/performance

# Monitor emergency stops
rostopic echo /<vehicle_name>/enhanced_navigation_node/emergency_stop
```

### Configuration

Edit `src/packages/navigation/config/enhanced_navigation_node/default.yaml`:

```yaml
# Risk Assessment Configuration
risk_assessment_enabled: true
risk_update_frequency: 10.0  # Hz

# Risk Thresholds
emergency_stop_threshold: "CRITICAL"
avoidance_threshold: "HIGH"

# Distance Parameters
safe_distance_threshold: 0.5      # meters
critical_distance_threshold: 0.3  # meters

# Object Risk Weights

## Logging and Monitoring

### Comprehensive Logging

The system provides detailed logging at multiple levels:

```python
# Risk factor calculations
rospy.logdebug(f"Distance: {distance:.2f}m -> Risk: {distance_risk:.3f}")
rospy.logdebug(f"Velocity: {velocity:.2f}m/s -> Risk: {velocity_risk:.3f}")

# Risk assessment results
rospy.loginfo(f"Object {i} Risk Assessment:")
rospy.loginfo(f"  Class: {detection.class_name} | Risk Level: {risk_level.name}")
rospy.loginfo(f"  Time to Collision: {ttc:.2f}s")

# Emergency conditions
rospy.logwarn(f"CRITICAL RISK detected for {detection.class_name}!")
```

### Real-time Monitoring

Performance metrics are published continuously:

```python
performance_report = {
    'timestamp': timestamp,
    'total_assessments': total_assessments,
    'average_assessment_time_ms': avg_time,
    'critical_detections': critical_count,
    'emergency_stops_triggered': emergency_stops
}
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Ground Projection Integration

Uses existing ground projection utilities for coordinate transformations:

```python
from image_processing.ground_projection_geometry import GroundProjectionGeometry

# Convert image coordinates to ground coordinates
ground_point = self.ground_projector.pixel2ground(pixel_point)
```

### Object Detection Integration

Compatible with existing object detection pipeline:

```python
# Subscribe to object detections
self.sub_detections = rospy.Subscriber(
    '~object_detections',
    ObjectDetectionArray,
    self.cb_object_detections
)
```

### Navigation System Integration

Extends existing navigation without breaking compatibility:

```python
# Publish navigation commands
navigation_cmd = Twist()
navigation_cmd.linear.x = computed_velocity
self.pub_navigation_command.publish(navigation_cmd)
```
