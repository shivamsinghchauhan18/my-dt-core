📋 COMPLETE .SH FILE RELEVANCE ANALYSIS

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 CURRENT ACTIVE SCRIPTS (HIGH RELEVANCE):

✅ src/scripts/realtime_robot_analysis.sh
   Purpose: Complete live robot analysis with SSH access
   Status: PRIMARY - Main real-time analysis tool
   
✅ src/scripts/intelligent_deployment.sh  
   Purpose: AI-powered adaptive deployment with live monitoring
   Status: PRIMARY - Main deployment orchestrator
   
✅ src/scripts/conflict_resolver.sh
   Purpose: Conflict detection and resolution for fork issues
   Status: PRIMARY - Safety and validation tool
   
✅ src/scripts/progressive_deployment.sh
   Purpose: Step-by-step component deployment (catkin integrated)
   Status: CORE COMPONENT - Used by intelligent_deployment.sh

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 SUPPORTING SCRIPTS (MEDIUM RELEVANCE):

⚠️  src/scripts/deploy_smart.sh
    Purpose: Original wrapper for deployment tools
    Status: SUPERSEDED by intelligent_deployment.sh
    Action: Keep as backup, but new system is superior
    
⚠️  src/scripts/ultra_monitoring.py (Python, not .sh)
    Purpose: System monitoring during deployment
    Status: INTEGRATED into realtime_robot_analysis.sh
    Action: Functionality absorbed into new scripts
    
⚠️  src/scripts/component_tester.py (Python, not .sh)
    Purpose: Component validation testing
    Status: INTEGRATED into intelligent_deployment.sh
    Action: Testing logic moved to shell scripts

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🗂️  LEGACY/OBSOLETE SCRIPTS (LOW RELEVANCE):

❌ src/scripts/deploy_pinkduckie.sh
   Purpose: Simple deployment to pinkduckie
   Status: OBSOLETE - Replaced by intelligent_deployment.sh
   
❌ src/scripts/deploy_pinkduckie_simple.sh  
   Purpose: Basic deployment without features
   Status: OBSOLETE - New system has all functionality
   
❌ src/scripts/deploy_duckietown_native.sh
   Purpose: Native Duckietown deployment
   Status: OBSOLETE - Not compatible with enhanced components
   
❌ src/scripts/deploy_catkin_workspace.sh
   Purpose: Basic catkin deployment
   Status: OBSOLETE - Superseded by progressive_deployment.sh
   
❌ src/scripts/deploy_source_only.sh
   Purpose: Source-only deployment
   Status: OBSOLETE - New system handles all deployment types
   
❌ src/scripts/deploy_optimal_integration.sh
   Purpose: Optimal integration deployment
   Status: OBSOLETE - Functionality integrated into intelligent system
   
❌ src/scripts/enhanced_deploy.sh
   Purpose: Enhanced deployment features
   Status: OBSOLETE - All features in new intelligent system
   
❌ src/scripts/enhanced_build.sh
   Purpose: Enhanced build process
   Status: OBSOLETE - Build logic integrated into deployment scripts

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🛠️  UTILITY SCRIPTS (KEEP AS-IS):

✅ src/scripts/setup_ssh_keys.sh
   Purpose: SSH key setup for robot access
   Status: UTILITY - Still relevant for setup
   
✅ src/scripts/pre_deployment_check.sh
   Purpose: Pre-deployment environment validation
   Status: UTILITY - Can be used before main deployment
   
✅ src/scripts/verify_catkin_deployment.sh
   Purpose: Post-deployment catkin verification
   Status: UTILITY - Useful for manual verification
   
✅ src/scripts/run_system_validation.sh
   Purpose: System validation checks
   Status: UTILITY - Complementary to new validation
   
✅ src/scripts/send-fsm-state.sh
   Purpose: FSM state management
   Status: UTILITY - Robot control utility
   
✅ src/scripts/catkin_deployment_explanation.sh
   Purpose: Documentation and examples
   Status: DOCUMENTATION - Educational value

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 SUMMARY:

CURRENT WORKFLOW (4 PRIMARY SCRIPTS):
1. src/scripts/conflict_resolver.sh detect
2. src/scripts/realtime_robot_analysis.sh complete  
3. src/scripts/intelligent_deployment.sh intelligent
4. src/scripts/conflict_resolver.sh report

DEPRECATED SCRIPTS (CAN BE ARCHIVED):
- deploy_pinkduckie*.sh (replaced by intelligent system)
- deploy_duckietown_native.sh (not compatible)
- deploy_catkin_workspace.sh (superseded)
- deploy_source_only.sh (obsolete)
- deploy_optimal_integration.sh (integrated)
- enhanced_deploy.sh (integrated)
- enhanced_build.sh (integrated)

KEEP AS UTILITIES:
- setup_ssh_keys.sh
- pre_deployment_check.sh  
- verify_catkin_deployment.sh
- run_system_validation.sh
- send-fsm-state.sh
- catkin_deployment_explanation.sh

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 RECOMMENDATION:

ACTIVE DEPLOYMENT: Use the 4 new intelligent scripts
LEGACY SCRIPTS: Archive but keep for reference
UTILITIES: Keep available for specific use cases

The new intelligent system consolidates all the best features from
previous scripts into a cohesive, AI-powered deployment framework.
