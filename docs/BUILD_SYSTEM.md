# Build for multiple architectures using Docker buildx
make buildx-setup
make buildx-prod  # Builds for both amd64 and arm64
```

### Build Monitoring

The script provides detailed monitoring:

```bash
# Real-time build progress
[2024-01-15 10:30:15] [BUILD] Step 1/25 : FROM duckietown/dt-ros-commons:daffy-amd64
[2024-01-15 10:30:16] [BUILD] ---> Using cache
[2024-01-15 10:30:16] [BUILD] Step 2/25 : ARG DISTRO

# Performance metrics
[2024-01-15 10:35:22] [INFO] Build completed for development in 307s
[2024-01-15 10:35:22] [INFO] Image size: 2.1GB
[2024-01-15 10:35:22] [INFO] Number of layers: 23

# Optimization recommendations
[2024-01-15 10:35:23] [WARN] Image size is large (2150MB) - consider optimization
```

## macOS Development Support

### Prerequisites

1. **Install XQuartz**:
   ```bash
   brew install --cask xquartz
   ```

2. **Configure XQuartz**:
   - Start XQuartz
   - Go to Preferences → Security
   - Check "Allow connections from network clients"

3. **Enable localhost connections**:
   ```bash
   xhost +localhost
   ```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Setup macOS environment
make macos-setup

# Start development shell with X11 forwarding
make shell-macos

# Test GUI applications (inside container)
xclock    # Should display a clock window
rviz      # ROS visualization tool
rqt       # ROS GUI tools
```

### X11 Forwarding Configuration

The system automatically configures X11 forwarding:

```dockerfile
# X11 forwarding setup in Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        x11-apps \
        x11-utils \
        x11-xserver-utils \
        xauth
```

Container startup with X11:
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
    duckietown/dt-core:daffy-devel-amd64
```

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration

The build system integrates with GitHub Actions for automated builds:

```yaml
# Example .github/workflows/build.yml
name: Enhanced Build
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        target: [development, testing, production]
        arch: [amd64, arm64]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
    - name: Build ${{ matrix.target }}
      run: ./scripts/enhanced_build.sh --arch ${{ matrix.arch }} ${{ matrix.target }}
```

### Build Validation

Automated validation includes:
- Dependency resolution verification
- Build success confirmation
- Image size monitoring
- Security scanning
- Performance benchmarking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures**:
```bash
# Check Docker daemon
docker info

# Clean build cache
make build-clean

# Check build logs
make build-info
```

**X11 Forwarding Issues on macOS**:
```bash
# Restart XQuartz
killall XQuartz
open -a XQuartz

# Reset X11 permissions
xhost +localhost

# Test X11 connection
echo $DISPLAY
```

**Performance Issues**:
```bash
# Monitor resource usage
docker stats

# Use production image for deployment
make build-prod

# Allocate more memory to Docker
# Docker Desktop → Preferences → Resources
```

### Build Logs

Build logs are automatically saved to `build_logs/` directory:

```bash
# View latest build log
tail -f build_logs/build_$(date +%Y%m%d)*.log

# Search for errors
grep ERROR build_logs/build_*.log

# Analyze build performance
grep "Build completed" build_logs/build_*.log
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring

The build script provides real-time performance monitoring:

```bash
# Enable monitoring during build
./scripts/enhanced_build.sh --monitor production

# Monitor output
[2024-01-15 10:30:45] [INFO] System performance - CPU: 45%, Memory: 8192 pages
[2024-01-15 10:31:15] [INFO] System performance - CPU: 67%, Memory: 12288 pages
```

### Build Analytics

Post-build analysis includes:
- Image size optimization recommendations
- Layer count analysis
- Dependency audit
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance benchmarking

## Best Practices

### Development
1. Use development image for active development
2. Mount source code for rapid iteration
3. Enable X11 forwarding for GUI debugging
4. Use comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Testing
1. Use testing image for CI/CD pipelines
2. Run tests in isolated containers
3. Generate coverage reports
4. Validate across multiple architectures

### Production
1. Use production image for deployment
2. Minimize image size and attack surface
3. Enable security scanning
4. Monitor runtime performance

### Cross-Platform
1. Test on both x86_64 and ARM64
2. Use Docker buildx for multi-architecture builds
3. Validate GUI applications on macOS
4. Ensure consistent behavior across platforms

This enhanced build system provides a robust foundation for developing, testing, and deploying the Advanced Autonomous Duckietown System while maintaining optimal performance and developer productivity across multiple platforms.
